# Weighted Dice

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is a website where users can make custom dice and roll them against each other.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Users will be able to make custom dice and roll them against each other. Each user will have 21 pips to distribute among 6 faces.

The goal is to have users try to find the best dice to beat their peers. Users can choose which die to roll against, and their win/loss/draw ratio will be tracked. Both users do not need to be online in order for a match to be made: an online user will pull a different user's die from the database.

### Design

![Design image](facade.png)

This is a (very) rough sketch of what the site will look like. Your dice and it's net are displayed, with the two most important buttons being front and center.
